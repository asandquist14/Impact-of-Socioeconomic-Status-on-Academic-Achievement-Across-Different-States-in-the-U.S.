"NOTE: ""Non-charter districts"" are districts where none of the associated schools are charter schools.  ""Charter districts"" are districts where all associated schools are charter schools.  ""Combined districts"" are districts in which there are both charter and non-charter schools.  District charter status for 2008–09 was derived using school-level data.  Schools with missing charter identification information were assumed to be non-charters for the purpose of this analysis.",,,,,,
